# Welcome to my Geospatial Analytics Learning Journey

Hello there! I am Phuong. Welcome to my **ISSS626 Geospatial Analysis and Application** homepage. This course is taught by Prof [KAM Tin Seong](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/kam-tin-seong-486) as part of my [Master of IT in Business program](https://masters.smu.edu.sg/programme/master-of-it-in-business) at Singapore Management University. In this website, you will find my coursework prepared for this course, encompassing practical application of different techniques to transform and analyze spatial data.

:::

-   **Hands-on Exercise**: Hands-on practice under the guidance given by Prof Kam, using relevant R packages to perform geospatial analysis using public data sources.

-   **In-class Exercise**: Extend from the methods learned through Hands-on Exercise and include analysis result communication through data visualization.

-   **Take-home Exercise**: **Synthesize learning** from course materials and above exercises to analyze real-world geospatial cases.
